    image:'images/lemons-sq.jpg',
description:"Seafood requires lemon and our roasted meats are basted with lemon juice as its natural sugar helps the surface brown and crisp. Wine vinegar steps in with bolder tartness and yogurt supplies the acidity to marinades, dips like tzatziki, and simple sauces.  "
